# Alpa_OpenSource

Please note: 
This version of Alpa is specially pushed in the spirit of open source. But, many files and implementations have been removed (like the networking layer) to maintain the security of the application as it is live on the App Store.
This version will is not inteded to build and will not run due to the missing files, but, feel free to take any inspiration from the repo.

Alpa is a free messaging app crafted to immerse you in the art of longer, meaningful conversations.
Simply read a message and Alpa analyses your emotions through the camera, conveying exactly what you felt to the sender.
